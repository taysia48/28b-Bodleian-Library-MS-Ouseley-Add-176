    "description":"This image features Faridun and Jamshid’s daughters \(some sources suggest they are Jamshid’s sisters\) upon their first meeting. Within the greater text of the Shahnama we learn that Faridun is revolting against the cruel and evil king named Zahak. Earlier in the story it is revealed that Zahak had a dream warning him how he would be defeated by Faridun. We also learn that Faridun’s father is Abtin, a descendant of Jamshid, meaning Faridun is of nobility. It is also revealed that Abtin was slain by Zahak \(Tafażżolī, 1999\), giving Faridun cause for revenge. In his attempt to defeat Zahak, Faridun cannot locate him. Faridun believes the sisters’, whose names are Shahrnāz and Arnavāz, may have information that will help. He is correct in his assumption. Because, at this time the two sisters are married to Zahak and so it would be reasonable to assume they would know the whereabouts of their husband. The sisters inform him that Zahak is in Hindústán practicing magic \(Ferdowsi 1905, 163\). They are willing to reveal Zahak’s whereabouts, likely because of the awful things he does and their shared desire to see him slain. Later, after defeating Zahak, Faridun marries both Shahrnāz and Arnavāz. The imagery here may allude to their future marriages as you can see both the sisters gazing lovingly towards Faridun."},

    "description":"\"The preliminary drawings for this work were made early in the spring of 1874. After a careful consideration of the subject, it was determined to locate the point of view so that the city would be seen from the southeast, believing that to be the most advantageous in all respects. Accordingly, the point of site was established on the Illinois side of the river, looking to the northwest, and at sufficient altitude to overlook the roofs of ordinary houses into the streets. A careful perspective, which required a surface of three hundred square feet, was then erected from a correct survey of the city, extending northward from Arsenal Island...\""},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
