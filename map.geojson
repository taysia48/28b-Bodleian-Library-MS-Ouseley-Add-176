    "description":"\t This image features Faridun and Jamshid’s daughters (some sources suggest they are Jamshid’s sisters) upon their first meeting. Within the greater text of the Shahnama we learn that Faridun is revolting against the cruel and evil king named Zahak. Earlier in the story it is revealed that Zahak had a dream warning him how he would be defeated by Faridun. We also learn that Faridun’s father is Abtin, a descendant of Jamshid, meaning Faridun is of nobility. It is also revealed that Abtin was slain by Zahak (Tafażżolī, 1999), giving Faridun cause for revenge. In his attempt to defeat Zahak, Faridun cannot locate him. Faridun believes the sisters’, whose names are Shahrnāz and Arnavāz, may have information that will help. He is correct in his assumption. Because, at this time the two sisters are married to Zahak and so it would be reasonable to assume they would know the whereabouts of their husband. The sisters inform him that Zahak is in Hindústán practicing magic (Ferdowsi 1905, 163). They are willing to reveal Zahak’s whereabouts, likely because of the awful things he does and their shared desire to see him slain. Later, after defeating Zahak, Faridun marries both Shahrnāz and Arnavāz. The imagery here may allude to their future marriages as you can see both the sisters gazing lovingly towards Faridun."},

    "description":"\t Faridun is the hero of the story. He is on a mission to end Zahak, an evil person who has taken many lives. Not only is he fated to destroy Zahak, but he is personally motivated. Zahak killed Faridun’s father. Throughout Faridun’s story outside this image, it is revealed that Faridun did not know his father before Zahak killed him (Tafażżolī 1999). In Faridun’s mind Zahak stole his ability to know his father. Further, Faridun’s mother revealed that his father was noble, and he did not know. In this image we see Faridun meeting with Zahak’s wives. Interestingly, a reader could read this as an opportunity to get revenge on Zahak by killing his wives and taking the ones that he loved from him. But that is not even in the slightest on the radar. Faridun is our hero and seeks his revenge only directly on the party who took from him. That being said he does take Zahak’s wives but not in spite, but because of love. Faridun marrying the two sisters furthers the Shahnama because he and the sisters conceive the future characters in the book, Tur, Iraj, and Salm (Shahbazi 1986). This image depicts the soft side of Faridun. His face shows a peaceful expression and his hands express gentleness. Though revenge is the ultimate goal, this scene gives a visual representation that he is at the core, a kind and honourable person."},

    "description":"\tIn the story arc between Faridun and Zahak, Shahrnāz and Arnavāz play a vital role. Though some of it by simple coincidence they allow Faridun to reach Zahak. The two are aware that Zahak fears Faridun will be his demise. Upon discovering they were in fact speaking with Faridun, Arnavāz says,\n\n\"[t]hen thou art Faridun the Shah and wilt\n\nAbolish necromacy and black art,\n\nFor thou art fated to destroy Zahhak…\"(Ferdowsi 1905, 163).\n\nShe goes on to express how the two only married Zahak due to fear they would be killed if they did not. The sisters are excited Faridun is fated to end Zahak in part because it will set them free. They reveal any information they have to help Faridun accomplish his goal, and in turn free them from their unwanted marriages to Zahak. The sisters know that Faridun will be their key to freedom. This is explained in the image with how lovingly they look toward Faridun. Not only are they important to Faridun’s story, but also to Zahak’s, their own, and their future children. All of which would be altered if they did not act as they do in this portion of the story.\n\n This all being said, the sisters' role in the Shahnama is a very typical depiction of women in these stories. Women were often included simply to be a part of a love story. (O’Rourke, 2011). The sisters do fill that role, but they also move the story along and provide important information to further the plot."},

    "description":"\t The image overwhelmingly gives a sense of togetherness. This is done primarily with the portrayal of touch. In the image Faridun is holding the hand of each of the sisters. This action shows intimacy and shows the viewer a sense of trust between the characters. Both Shahrnāz and Arnavāz have their heads tilted in towards Faridun, this brings viewers eyes inward to the centre of the image, closing the gaze inward. Togetherness is shown by the artist by the simplicity of the entire image. The only action in the image is happening in a condensed part of the image. The artist kept the rest of the page very minimal. By doing this the viewer does not have a lot to focus on. Doing so, even though there is a lot of empty room in the scene, makes the scene feel closed in, again expressing togetherness and intimacy. The scene depicts a small part of a greater story filled with violence and yet this scene feels calm. Although the greater text around this includes characters pitted against one another this is a small moment of characters coming together peacefully. By specifically showing this moment the artist has alluded to the eventual marriages these characters will have."},

    "description":"\tThe artist included the text in an interesting manner when setting up this page. Typically, there is a clean separation between text and image, but in this case the writing is on the walls. Text can be seen in three places on the page all of which are strategically placed to create the building in which the three characters sit. There is a parallel between the writing contained on the walls and the walls themselves. The walls are support for the building; they help keep the structure sound. Likewise, this particular part of the story is a major building block and driving force for Faridun finding Zahak as well as the marriages he will eventually share with both Shahrnāz and Arnavāz. Both the walls and the writing are in their own right structurally important. \n\n As mentioned, there is a theme of togetherness in this image. The writing making up the walls supports this theme as it shows the story all around the characters. The writing encases the characters giving a sense that the story brings them closer together and provides the structure their love stories will be built on. \n\n By the artist using such a unique layout they ensure the viewer will ponder the reasoning for such an interesting choice. Doing this means that the layout is successful in promoting relfection. "},

    "description":"\tThough many images in this particular manuscript depict images of action or violence, this particular one does not. The image is by all means, plain. Although there are patterns all over the image there is no intense contrast or anything eye-catching about it. There is no movement, the colours and patterns are simple, the characters are sitting, and the image includes no furniture or decoration. The artist likely did this deliberately in order to express the lull that exists at this time. Before this scene Faridun is on the hunt for Zahak, and after is when he indeed finds Zahak, and their story continues. This scene is both a plateau after the action and the calm before the storm. The simplicity does not create a sense of urgency or stress, it does not leave one on the edge of their seat. It simply represents a moment in time. The artist made choices that allowed the story to speak for itself, though the image does depict what is happening in the written work, it does not try to tell much more. Of course, the artist included things the viewer could look at and extract meaning from, but nothing glaringly obvious. It was meant to be subtle. "},

    "description":"\tThe colours gold/yellow and red are prevalent in the clothing of all three characters. Shahrnāz and Arnavāz are wearing exclusive those two colours. The only difference is that one is wearing more red than yellow/gold, and the other more yellow/gold than red. In Faridun’s dress the main colour is purple, however the pattern on top is gold. Additionally, his sleeves are red, and his crown is also red and yellow/gold. \n\n Multiple things occur with this use of colour. First the characters are connected because of this similarity. The sisters match so closely in dress it is plain to see they share a lot. Not only are they, of course, sisters, but they marry the same man in two separate instances. The matching colours also connect them with Faridun. Faridun shares some of the same colours which instills a sense of connectedness. The three seem as if they are a matching set. \n\n Next is the meaning of these prevalent colours within Iranian culture. \n\n The use of yellow/gold often represents prestige and royalty (Soucek 1992). For these characters this makes sense because they come from a prestigious heritage, all being descendants of Jamshid. The use of red can have many meanings, including life and fertility Soucek 1992). The red is meaningful in their future lives together and the family they build. \n\n Finally, when paired together red represents the beloved, while yellow represents the beloved (Soucek 1992). Interestingly all three contain both colours. This likely is done because they are all both the beloved and lover within their relationships to each other. The colours chosen when creating this image feel intentional, because of the simplistic nature of the image the colours act as additional layers of interest the artist snuck in."},
